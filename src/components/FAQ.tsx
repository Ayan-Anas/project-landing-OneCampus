      question: "How do you handle student privacy?",
      answer: "Campus One operates on a read-only basis wherever possibleâ€”we pull information from your existing systems but never store passwords. Students can request deletion of their data at any time, and we're fully FERPA compliant.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does setup take?",
      answer: "Most institutions are up and running with a pilot in hours, not weeks. Our team handles the initial configuration, and you can start with a single department to test before scaling campus-wide.",
    },
    {
      question: "What integrations do you support?",
      answer: "We start with simple URL-based feeds and grow with your needs. Native integrations include common LMS platforms, event management systems, and SSO providers. Custom integrations available for enterprise plans.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can we customize the branding?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Campus One supports your institution's colors, logo, and even custom domain. Students see a seamless extension of your brand, not a third-party platform.",
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of support do you provide?",
      answer: "All plans include email support. Institution and Custom tiers get priority support, training sessions, and ongoing optimization help. We're committed to your success from day one.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a contract commitment?",
      answer: "Our pilot program is designed to be low-risk. Start with a department-level trial, measure results, then expand if it makes sense. No long-term commitment required for pilots.",
    },
